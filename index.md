Hey! I'm Adithya, currently a final-year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. I'm pursuing my B.Tech in Chemical Engineering (with minors in Computer Science). 

I have explored a lot of things in college and you can find most of them here. One thing that sticks is that I love using software to solve problems and make people's lives efficient. I have worked on a lot of impactful projects in my insti life and would like to keep doing that. 

## Activities that I have been a part of:
- Institute System Administrator: Overseeing the LAN network to ensure uninterrupted internet access for a campus with 10,000+ students. Additionally, maintaining and managing Gymkhana servers that host websites for student bodies and applications used by the student community.
- Overall Coordinator of DevCom: Heading a team of 30 developers and designers dedicated to addressing student needs through software solutions. Successful projects include InstiApp (10k+ downloads on Play Store), Mess-i (a mess digitalization system utilized by 10,000+ students), and Resobin (a course information repository).
- Student Mentor:
  - Institute Student Mentor (ISMP): Mentoring 12 freshmen from diverse backgrounds to ensure a smooth transition into college life
  - Senior Mentor: Guiding 2 students part of the institute's Academic Rehabilitation Program.
  - Department Academic Mentor: Guided 6 sophomores in making informed decisions in their academic and extra-curricular pursuits
- Teaching Assistant: CS101 - Computer Programming and Utilization course at IIT Bombay 
  
## Hobbies and other interests:
Most often, you would find me reading a book during breaks. Some of my favourites are Dune, The Godfather and of course, Harry Potter. I also love watching movies, though I always maintain that books are better than adaptations. I occasionally enjoy HIMYM, TBBT and B99. 

Even though I am not into sports, I love cycle rides and feel the wind in my hair. Even though I don't play, I follow cricket and football (Messi ~~Ronaldo~~). I am also a productivity nerd, and enjoy organising my life using Notion, Todoist etc. 

I did a fair amount of quizzing (spend a lot of time reading random Wikipedia pages) and enjoy finding trivia wherever I go. I love making rational arguments and loves debating (and always up for one).
